
For each of the 20 mice, we extracted BOLD timeseries (1870 timepoints) and saved them as .mat files, with each column representing one ROI and each row one timepoint.
Regions/voxels are ordered per hemisphere. 
This means that the first 86 columns represent all the ROIs (from Primary Motor Area to Paraflocculus) from one hemisphere, and that starting from 87 they represent the other hemisphere with the exact same ordering.
The ordering is the same that can be found in the macro_atlas_n_172_rois_excel_final.xlsx
