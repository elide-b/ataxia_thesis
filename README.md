## by Elide Brunelli 
Supervisor Marialaura De Grazia, and Professors Egidio D'Angelo & Claudia Casellato


This thesis aims to model the mouse brain in the specific case of ataxia (tottering mice->SCA6) through The Virtual Mouse Brain (TVMB), the Allen Brain Mouse, and data from Gozzi's Functional Neuroimaging lab (Pagani et al., 2021, Nature Communications).
